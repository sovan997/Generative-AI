### RAG Application Using Llama2

### Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application leveraging the Llama2 model. The system combines the power of retrieval-based techniques with generative language models to provide precise and context-aware responses by augmenting the modelâ€™s outputs with external knowledge.

### Features

Integration of a retrieval mechanism to enhance model accuracy.

Utilization of Llama2, a state-of-the-art language model.

Support for domain-specific knowledge integration.

Scalable and modular architecture suitable for production environments.
